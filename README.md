Problem: Explicit Bias  

Solution: Discrimination, hate speech, and other forms of explicit bias are the product of purposeful thought. As a result, they can be intentionally controlled. When there are societal norms in place that state that prejudice is not socially acceptable, people are more driven to moderate their biases. Policies must include discipline and distinguish between explicit and unconscious bias. If an officer does exhibit blatantly discriminatory behavior, the issue must be addressed immediately and efficiently by a supervisor, preferably with the support of clear policies like the one in Connecticut.
